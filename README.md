# Broke-Out
10 level brick breaker
The theme here is a low quality game. Sprites made in MSPaint and voice lines that talk obnoxiously over each other. It makes for a fun silly game, and it was fun to make. It's supposed to representative of the criticism towards the "juicyness" concept. Just adding these things doesn't alone make a good game. This game isn't good. It is, however, very juicy. It is fun though, if you can take it in ironically.

## Implementation
10 levels
Replay/quit during end menu w/ delay that waits for sound
new win menu
shaders for end menu, win menu, and main menu backgrounds
redid the sound implementation- now they're on the objects itself rather than

New assets created by myself made in MSPaint. (And then made transparent in an actual program. MSPaint gives the sprites the "low-quality" style I was going for)
New sound effects recorded by myself with a randomizer that chooses a random one
